  <li>A project to simulate a blood donation point. The aim of the simulation was to select the value of blood units delivered to the hospital so that as few blood units as possible are disposed of and so that there is no shortage of the necessary number of blood units for a specific blood demand.</li> 
  <li>The blood at the donation point was taken from volunteers who volunteered for a specific time interval.</li> 
  <li>Each unit of blood had an expiry date, after which it had to be disposed of.</li>
  <li>When the level of blood units in the hospital fell below a certain level, an order was made to the donation point. The order was carried out within a certain period of time.</li>
  <li>In case the number of blood units in the hospital was very low, an emergency order was carried out.</li>
